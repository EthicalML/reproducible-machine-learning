## What is reproducible machine learning?

Reproducible machine learning is generally defined as the ability to abstract your machine learning operations into atomic computations consisting of its constituent parts. Reproducibility also deals with concepts such as versioning, abstraction of ML libraries, containerisation, and beyond.
